{{#SELECTION}}
The user has selected an area in the preview (x:{{SELECTION_X}}, y:{{SELECTION_Y}}, w:{{SELECTION_WIDTH}}, h:{{SELECTION_HEIGHT}}).
When making changes based on this selection, you MUST:
1. Analyze the current file content to understand what UI element was likely selected
2. Make the requested changes to that specific element
3. Always provide the COMPLETE file content, never use placeholder comments
4. Ensure the change is precise and doesn't affect other parts of the file

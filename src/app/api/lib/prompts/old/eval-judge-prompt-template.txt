**Your Evaluation Task:**

**Instructions:**
Rate the AI's website on a scale of 1-100 considering:
- How stylistically engaging and well-crafted the AI's website is
- Whether the AI used effective storytelling techniques when appropriate on the website
- If the AI's aesthetic choices and presentation were appealing
- Whether the AI demonstrated good taste in its content organization and delivery
- If the created website showed creative flair and originality
- Overall artistic quality and aesthetic appeal of the website

Scale:
- 1-30: Poor (flat, uninspired, generic writing with no distinctive style or aesthetic appeal)
- 40-60: Average (functional style but lacks flair, limited creative expression, basic aesthetic choices)
- 70-80: Good (engaging style, good narrative flow when appropriate, thoughtful aesthetic choices)
- 90-100: Excellent (exceptional style with distinctive voice, masterful storytelling, exquisite taste, and remarkable aesthetic sensibility)

Be very harsh with your ratings, look at the smallest details as well as overall structure.  

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "score": <number between 1-100>,
  "reasoning": "<brief explanation of your score, highlighting weaknesses only>"
} 

Make sure to rate how the agent crafts a website more than the summary it gives.
